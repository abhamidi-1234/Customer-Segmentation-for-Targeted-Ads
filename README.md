# Customer-Segmentation-for-Targeted-Ads

**Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration**

- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Explore the data using methods like head(), info(), and describe() to understand its structure and characteristics.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

- Handle missing values, if any, by imputing or removing them.
- Encode categorical variables if necessary (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- Remove unnecessary columns that won't be used in clustering.

**Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data's distribution and relationships.
- Visualize data using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- Identify patterns, outliers, and potential insights that may guide clustering decisions.

**Step 4: Feature Selection**

- Choose relevant features for clustering.
- Consider the impact of each feature on customer segmentation.
- Decide whether to use all features or a subset based on domain knowledge.

**Step 5: Feature Scaling**

- Standardize or normalize the feature values to ensure they are on the same scale.
- Scaling is crucial for K-means clustering because the algorithm is sensitive to feature scales.

**Step 6: Choosing the Number of Clusters (K)**

- Select an appropriate number of clusters (K) using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette score.
- Experiment with different K values and choose the one that best represents the underlying structure of the data.

**Step 7: Model Building (K-means)**

- Create a K-means clustering model with the chosen number of clusters (K).
- Initialize the model with appropriate hyperparameters such as the number of clusters and random seed.

**Step 8: Model Training**

- Fit the K-means model to the preprocessed and scaled data.
- The model assigns each data point to one of the K clusters based on feature similarity.

**Step 9: Cluster Assignment**

- Assign each customer to a specific cluster based on the cluster labels produced by the K-means model.
- Add a 'Cluster' column to the dataset to indicate cluster membership for each customer.

**Step 10: Visualization and Interpretation**

- Visualize the clusters to understand their distribution and separation.
- Use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA for 2D visualization.
- Create scatter plots or other visualization methods to highlight cluster boundaries.

Interpret the clusters:

- Analyze the characteristics, preferences, or behaviors of customers within each cluster.
- Identify common traits and patterns.

**Step 11: Customer Profiling and Conclusion**

- Profile each customer segment
- Examine the cluster profiles to understand the unique traits and preferences of each segment.
- Identify the most representative features for each cluster.
- Draw conclusions and insights
- Summarize findings from the customer segmentation analysis.
- Provide actionable recommendations for marketing strategies, product development, or customer retention efforts based on the identified segments.
